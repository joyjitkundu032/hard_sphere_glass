# hard_sphere_glass
This prog simulates a polydisperse system of hard spheres in arbitrary dimension D using swap Monte carlo. Here we choose conituous polydispersity with the mean diameter being 1. At high enough packing fractions, it exhibit glassy behaviour. 

The code spits out particle trajectories at a fixed time interval.
